# Graph-based-Image-Pattern-Detection-System
A scalable system for detecting image patterns using graph-based analysis. Converts images into numerical features to build Region Adjacency Graphs (RAGs), compares graphs for similarity, enables user classification, and finds paths between graph nodes representing images.
